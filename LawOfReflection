function fom=LawOfReflection(x,h,p,s,o)

% This program calculates wether the law of reflection is holding, based on an object
% location (o), an observer location (s), the radius of the base do the conical mirror (p),
% the height of the conical mirror (h), and the x coordinate for a point on the cone where
% a ray is reflecting from.

% The end result is that if fom (figure of merit) is large, the law of reflection is not holding.
% So using script to minimze the output of this function with respect to the input x coordinate
% will determine where on the mirror a ray will reflect from object to observer


m=[x,0,-h/p*x+h]; % equation for surface of conical mirror

dn=[h/sqrt(p^2+h^2),0,p/sqrt(p^2+h^2)]; % normal vector of conical mirror

dsUNNORM=[s(1)-m(1),s(2)-m(2),s(3)-m(3)]; % specular reflection vector
% vector pointing from mirror surface to observer
ds=dsUNNORM./abs(norm(dsUNNORM)); % normalized specular reflection vector

diUNNORM=[o(1)-m(1),o(2)-m(2),o(3)-m(3)]; % incident ray vector, vector
% vector pointing from mirror to object
di=diUNNORM./abs(norm(diUNNORM)); % normalized incident ray vector

fom=norm(ds-2*dot(dn,di)*dn+di); % fom (figure of merit), should equal zero
% if law of reflection is holding. This is the variable that needs to be
% minimized to determine the point on the mirror that will cause a ray to
% reflect from the object to the observer
